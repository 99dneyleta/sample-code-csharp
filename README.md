# Sample C# Code for Authorize.Net
This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate C# integration with the Authorize.Net .NET SDK
The samples are organized just like our API, which you can also try out directly here: http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference


##Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

##Running the Samples
 Clone this repository.
 Build the project to produce the SampleCode console app.  
 Then run a sample directly by name:
````
     > SampleCode [CodeSampleName]
````
e.g.
````
     > SampleCode ChargeACreditCard
````
Running SampleCode without a parameter will give you the list of sample names.  Handy or what!
